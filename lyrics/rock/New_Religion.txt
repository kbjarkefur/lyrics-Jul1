A city of strangers, the streetlights, they change us
We all need a little bit more, we all need a little bit more
The saints and the liars, the dealers and buyers
We all need a little bit more, we all need a little bit more

But somewhere there's a light
A sign that it's alright
I find it by your side

People get lost in repetition
Working and watching television
Hard to wake up in the morning
It's hard to wake up in the morning
I'm watching you dancing in the kitchen
I could call you my new religion
You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah

You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning

Chaos inside us, it turns into silence
'Cause we've got a little bit more
'Cause we've got a little bit more
The cracks in your ceiling as deep as the feeling
We've got a little bit more, we've got a little bit more

But somewhere there's a light
A sign that it's alright
I find it by your side

People get lost in repetition
Working and watching television
Hard to wake up in the morning
It's hard to wake up in the morning
I'm watching you dancing in the kitchen
I could call you my new religion
You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah

You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah
You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah

Waking me up in the morning, yeah

People get lost in repetition
Working and watching television
Hard to wake up in the morning
It's hard to wake up in the morning
I'm watching you dancing in the kitchen
I could call you my new religion
You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah

You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah
You're waking me up in the morning
You're waking me up in the morning, yeah
