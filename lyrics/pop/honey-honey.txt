Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy
Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna hurt you baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before (I'd heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more (I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine Oh, you make me dizzy
